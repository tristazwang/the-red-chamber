                        <h2>The Short Story that Inspired the 2024 Met Gala’s Theme</h2>
                        <p>In an unnamed place and time, a majestic villa overlooks a garden of delicate, glass-stemmed flowers. Home to Count Axel and the Countess, the otherwise elegant landscape is unsettled by a dark blot on the horizon: an army of furious workers, drawing nearer day by day. To slow the army’s approach, Axel plucks the time flowers from his garden; each one dissolves in a burst of light which rewinds time itself, and so the threatening horde shifts back on the skyline. This solution, however, is only temporary. The garden of time is faltering, the flowers are almost all gone, and the masses will soon arrive to take their long-awaited revenge.</p>
                        <p>This is the premise of <span class="italic">The Garden of Time,</span> a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. Previously lesser-known, the work of science fiction has recently been propelled into the limelight due to its nomination as the theme for the 2024 Met Gala, the annual haute couture fundraising festival held for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. So why was this tale chosen? How might it influence celebrity fashion? And what can they — and we — learn from it?</p>

                        <fig>
                            <img src="images/tems-met-gala.jpg" alt="Tems wearing a feathery outfit at the 2023 Met Gala.">

                        </fig>

                        <p>For a modern reader, the environmental implications of Ballard’s story are unmistakable. The Garden of Time is frail; hence the time flowers are likened texturally to glass — translucent, brittle and ghostly. Who or what is threatening this ecosystem? On one hand, the army is the force which eventually raids the landscape. Yet, the garden is already exploited by the count and countess, as they tear the flowers apart one by one to buy themselves time and protection from the workers’ wrath. This dual threat can be viewed as a metaphor for how both mass industry and aristocratic greed drive environmental destruction.</p>
                        <p>What Ballard makes overt is that our own decline is inherent in the decimation of nature; when the last flower is plucked, the count and countess are not only left vulnerable to the army, but they also literally turn to stone. Already, though, there seems to be a paradox at the core of the Met Gala theme. After all, it is (fast) fashion which is a leading cause of the very environmental crisis that is uncovered by Ballard. We might question how a fashion event will respond to this tension. Designers may, for instance, endeavour to use sustainable materials or to make eco-political statements through clothing. And what about the jet-setting ways of many of the celebrities in attendance? It will be interesting to see whether the celebrities channel the theme into a reflection on their environmental impact or whether it is all just about the aesthetic.</p>
                        
                        <fig>

                            <figcaption>“During his entire lifetime he had failed to notice a single evidence of growth among the flowers. The larger blooms had always been mature, and none of the buds had shown the slightest development.” — J.G. Ballard, The Garden of Time (1962)</figcaption>
                        </fig>
                        
                        <p>Furthermore, <span class="italic">The Garden of Time</span> is arguably as much about the clash between social groups as it is about the decline of nature. In the army, we can see the revenge of the proletariat as shown in other literary works like Émile Zola’s <span class="italic">Germinal.</span> But is Ballard championing or criticising this force?</p>
                        <p>In his presentation of the unequal conflict between the isolated count and countess on one side and “the ceaseless tide of humanity” on the other, Ballard may be commenting on the collapse of so-called refined society in the face of mass consumeristic forces. The people are depicted as a brutish and chaotic crowd that will destroy the idyll of polite society, where the countess whiles the days away romantically playing Mozart and Bach. Despite the futuristic nature of the story, then, there initially seems to be something conservative about its message.</p>
                        
                        <fig>

                        </fig> 
                        
                        <p>Conversely, the tale may point to the inevitable fall of the aristocracy. The count and countess appear as the last remaining figureheads of a bygone age, one which can only suspend its downfall for so long. Tellingly, the story ends with the victory of the working class over the precious few — perhaps a slightly bitter pill to swallow for some of the millionaire celebrities in attendance.</p>
                        <p>There may be a hint of pretentiousness underlying the need for an obscure, intellectual theme for this event. It is as if the celebrities are aligning themselves with the sophisticated count and countess, the emblems of “high society.” Will they pick up on the ironies at work here, and how might this be reflected in their costume choices?</p>
                        <p>Short though it may be, <span class="italic">The Garden of Time</span> provides abundant material for fashion concepts at this year’s Met Gala, while its broader social, political and environmental commentaries continue to provoke debate, even six decades on from its initial publication.</p>

                            <p><span class="italic">Little Women</span> has been adapted so many times over the years that certain images have become cemented in the public imagination: the family gathered around a letter from Father at Christmastime, the burnt manuscript, Amy falling through the ice, Jo cutting her hair to pay for Marmee’s journey. Greta Gerwig’s new movie contains all of these requisite scenes, but it reimagines the story as a whole by turning it into a work of art about its own making, further blurring the lines between author Louisa May Alcott and her semi-autobiographical heroine, Jo March.</p>

                            <p><span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> is perhaps the most well-known love story in the English language; it is so famous that the titular characters have ascended to the status of metaphor. The play is seen as the archetypal romantic tragedy, the quintessential tragic love story. However, <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> isn’t a love story, it’s simply tragic. The couple’s “love,” presented with ample doses of irony and bad taste, is merely a caricature. Furthermore, lest readers forget, Romeo and Juliet are teenagers — Juliet on the cusp of turning 14, Romeo likely just a few years older than her.</p>

                            <p>As our society becomes increasingly digitized, <span class="italic">The Veldt</span> seems to be more relevant than ever, despite being written by Ray Bradbury more than 70 years ago. In Bradbury’s short story, the Hadley family lives a life of leisure in a fully automated house. The “Happylife Home” does it all for them: it cooks their meals, helps them bathe, and even ties their shoelaces. However, parents George and Lydia become increasingly concerned by their children Peter and Wendy's fascination with the “nursery,” a virtual reality room that can realistically reproduce any place they imagine.</p>
