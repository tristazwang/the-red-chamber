                            <p>In an unnamed place and time, a majestic villa overlooks a garden of delicate, glass-stemmed flowers. Home to Count Axel and the Countess, the otherwise elegant landscape is unsettled by a dark blot on the horizon: an army of furious workers, drawing nearer day by day. To slow the army’s approach, Axel plucks the time flowers from his garden; each one dissolves in a burst of light which rewinds time itself, and so the threatening horde shifts back on the skyline. This solution, however, is only temporary. The garden of time is faltering, the flowers are almost all gone, and the masses will soon arrive to take their long-awaited revenge.</p>

                            <p>Malcolm Gladwell’s book <span class="italic">Talking to Strangers</span> examines the ways we misinterpret and fail to communicate with each other. Gladwell presents readers with compelling case studies and fascinating research that show just how bad humans are at spotting deception, even at close quarters, and how wrong we are to think we are good judges of character.</p>

                            <p><span class="italic">Little Women</span> has been adapted so many times over the years that certain images have become cemented in the public imagination: the family gathered around a letter from Father at Christmastime, the burnt manuscript, Amy falling through the ice, Jo cutting her hair to pay for Marmee’s journey. Greta Gerwig’s new movie contains all of these requisite scenes, but it also reimagines the story by turning it into a work of art about its own making, further blurring the lines between author Louisa May Alcott and her semi-autobiographical heroine, Jo March.</p>

                            <p><span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> is perhaps the most well-known love story in the English language; it is so famous that the titular characters have ascended to the status of metaphor. The play is seen as the archetypal romantic tragedy, the quintessential tragic love story. However, <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> isn’t a love story, it’s simply tragic. The couple’s “love,” presented with ample doses of irony and bad taste, is merely a caricature. Furthermore, lest readers forget, Romeo and Juliet are teenagers — Juliet on the cusp of turning 14, Romeo likely just a few years older than her.</p>

In Bradbury’s short story, the Hadley family lives a life of leisure in a fully automated house. The “Happylife Home” does it all: it cooks for the Hadleys, helps them bathe, and even ties their shoelaces. However, parents George and Lydia become increasingly concerned by their children Peter and Wendy's fascination with the “nursery,” a virtual reality room that can realistically reproduce any place they imagine.</p>

                            <p>Michelle Zauner’s memoir <span class="italic">Crying in Hmart</span> is, among other things, about Korean food, the confusion that comes with a biracial identity, and Zauner’s fraught relationship with her hyper-demanding Korean mother, who eventually died to cancer. Shortly after <span class="italic">Crying in Hmart’s</span> release, it became wildly successful — lauded as “an artistic triumph,” the book won the 2021 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography, stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for more than 40 weeks, and may even be adapted to the big screen. Yet, readers with reservations about Zauner’s memoir may be relieved to discover that there are others who share their opinions. At times, <span class="italic">Crying in Hmart</span> is incoherent, unengaging, and excessively flowery.</p>
