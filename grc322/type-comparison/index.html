             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Futura</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Futura was designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927 by the Bauer Type Foundry (Bauersche Gießere),
				a type foundry based in Frankfurt, Germany. Renner created Futura as a contribution to the New Frankfurt project,
				an affordable public housing program to promote simplicity, modernism, and industrialization. This typeface was advertised
				as “the font of our time” in the early 20th century. Although Futura wasn’t officially associated with the famed Bauhaus
				school, Futura’s clean design embodies the recognized “form follows function” ideology. This typeface carries a distinct
				style based on geometric form in comparison to the elaborate, handwritten appearances of other sans serif typefaces.</p>
             
			 <h3>Mr Eaves Mod</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
             <p>Mr Eaves is a sans serif font designed by Zuzana Licko in 2009 from the type foundry Emigre in Berkeley, California. A relatively
				new addition to the type foundry and typographic scene, Mr Eaves was designed to complement its renowned serif counterpart, Mrs Eaves.
				They are related to Baskerville, with both Mrs Eaves and Mr Eaves maintaining an uppercase “R” and “Q” with accents that are
				reminiscent of the highly accented serif tail. The characters of Mr Eaves are made to look as if their original serif tails have been
				cut off, most evident in the joint angle of the letter “z”. As a newer typeface, Mr Eaves is gradually being incorporated into modern
				designs, particularly with Mr Eaves Sans as used in printed design.
