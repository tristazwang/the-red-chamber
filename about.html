                <img src="about.jpeg" alt="Bird's eye view of various dim sum plates spread out on a table, with 2 hands holding chopsticks picking up food items">
                <p>Although dim sum is typically eaten with family and friends, sometimes you're just too busy for that. By the time you've sat down, poured tea, dodged deeply personal questions from distant relatives, and flagged down the food carts, hours will have passed.</p>
                <p>We understand that it's not easy to make that kind of time, all the time. However, we think everyone deserves to eat comforting, home-cooked food, regardless of one's schedule.</p>
                <p>Thus, we established the Red Chamber. The Red Chamber offers take-out dim sum that is convenient and well-priced, but no less tasty than what you'll find at a sit-down restaurant.</p>
                <p>Our food is 100% authentic and made fresh daily with locally-sourced ingredients. We firmly believe in giving back to the vibrant community that raised and supported us.</p>
                <p>The Red Chamber is, and will always be, family-owned and run. Words can't express how thankful we are for our customers and your continued patronage.</p>
